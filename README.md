# Image file handling functions for Booosta PHP Framework without upload features

This modules provides image file functions like resizing for the Booosta Framework. It does not provide
upload functions. Use booosta/imagefile if you need to upload an image file.

Booosta allows to develop PHP web applications quick. It is mainly designed for small web applications.
It does not provide a strict MVC distinction. Although the MVC concepts influence the framework. Templates,
data objects can be seen as the Vs and Ms of MVC.

Up to version 3 Booosta was available at Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/booosta/ From version
4 on it resides on Github and is available from Packagist under booosta/booosta .

This is an early development version which cannot be used yet. Get Booosta 3 from Sourceforge or wait for
a usable version. Sorry, there will be no (easy) upgrade path from Booosta 3 to Booosta 4.
